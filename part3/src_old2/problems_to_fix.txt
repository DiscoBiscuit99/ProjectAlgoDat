First and foremost, there is a problem with the Huffman tree generation:
Some characters are encoded as a substrings of other character encodings.
This is bad, since the longer encoded characters will then never be interpreted.

Secondly, there may be a problem with the decoding algorithm, but this is hard to test without a working encoding algorithm. First things first.
